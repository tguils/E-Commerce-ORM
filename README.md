# E-Commerce ORM

## Description

This application is an app which includes the database for an e-commerce website. The database includes items for the website.


## Usage

To initiate and use this app the user must ensure that express and MySQL are installed by typing "npm i" in the command line. The user will then run the schema database and then type "npm run seed" in the command line. The user should be able to see a table of items from the database seeds. The user will be able to create, update, and delete items from the database.


# issues

Need to fix bug to be able to run the seeds and test in insomnia. Unable to connect at this point.
